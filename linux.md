## `grep`

## Captalization Insensitive
Use `-i` to make grep insensitive to capitalization
### Use `grep` to search for the header file to include
Suppose that I find `AddContactMaterial` function from the documentation, I can determin which header file to include by using the powerful grep:
```
grep -nr --include \*.h -A2 "AddContactMaterial" ~/drake 
```
The output would be like:
```c++
/home/chenwang/drake/geometry/proximity_properties.h:94: * AddContactMaterial() adds general contact material properties to the given
/home/chenwang/drake/geometry/proximity_properties.h-95- * set of proximity `properties`. These are the properties required by the
/home/chenwang/drake/geometry/proximity_properties.h-96- * default point contact model. However, other contact models can opt to use

/home/chenwang/drake/geometry/proximity_properties.h:107:void AddContactMaterial(
/home/chenwang/drake/geometry/proximity_properties.h-108-    const std::optional<double>& dissipation,
/home/chenwang/drake/geometry/proximity_properties.h-109-    const std::optional<double>& point_stiffness,

/home/chenwang/drake/multibody/hydroelastics/hydroelastic_user_guide_doxygen.h:290:AddContactMaterial() isnâ€™t hydroelastic contact specific, but does provide a
/home/chenwang/drake/multibody/hydroelastics/hydroelastic_user_guide_doxygen.h-291-mechanism for setting the friction coefficients that hydroelastic and point
/home/chenwang/drake/multibody/hydroelastics/hydroelastic_user_guide_doxygen.h-292-contact models both use.
--
/home/chenwang/drake/multibody/plant/multibody_plant.h:1452:  ///   the function geometry::AddContactMaterial(), or
/home/chenwang/drake/multibody/plant/multibody_plant.h-1453-  /// - define it in an input URDF/SDFormat file as detailed here:
/home/chenwang/drake/multibody/plant/multibody_plant.h-1454-  ///   @ref tag_drake_hunt_crossley_dissipation.
```
Then I know that `AddContactMaterial` is defined in `proximity_properties.h`.

## `find`
Check (`the missing semester`)[https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/]

```python
# Find all directories named src
find . -name src -type d
# Find all python files that have a folder named test in their path
find . -path '*/test/*.py' -type f
# Find all files modified in the last day
find . -mtime -1
# Find all zip files with size in range 500k to 10M
find . -size +500k -size -10M -name '*.tar.gz'
```

## `apt`
1. Use `apt search *keyword*` to search for available package. This is very useful if you are not sure about the full name of the package.

## `mv`
`mv` does not show progress. Consider use `rsync`

## zsh-vi-mode
### missing letters after copy-paste
In Vim and vi-mode, if you paste text while in normal mode, it can interpret the pasted text as a series of commands, which can lead to unexpected behaviors, like missing letters. 

Before pasting, make sure you're in insert mode. Press `i` to enter insert mode, and then paste the text. This way, the pasted content is treated as plain text and not as a series of vi commands.

### Edit Profile
- Note that the profiles are case-sensitive. One example is that you shuold use `DIRECT` consistently. Inconsistent usage like `direct` will cause error.


## input and output stream

1. `< file` and `> file`: rewire the input and output streams of a program to a file respectively
2. `>>` append to a file

## terminal shortcuts
1. use `fc` to edit last command in vim
2. use `ctrl + w` to delete a word (backward)

## Enable and disable `wifi` through command line
```
sudo nmcli radio wifi off
sudo nmcli radio wifi on
```
Alternative choice is to use
```
sudo nmtui
```
which offers a gui in the terminal. More intuitive.

Other related things:
- Show wifi list
    ```
    nmcli d wifi list
    ```
